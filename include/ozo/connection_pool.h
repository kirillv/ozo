/**
 * @brief Connection pool implementation
 * @ingroup group-connection-types
 *
 * This is a simple implementation connection pool (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool">wikipedia</a>).
 * Connection pool allows to store established connections and reuse it to avoid a connect operation for each request.
 * It supports asynchronous request for connections using a queue with optional limits of capacity and wait time.
 * Also connection in the pool may be closed when it is not used for some time - idle timeout.
 *
 * This is how `connection_pool` handles user request to get a #Connection object:
 *
 * * If there is a free connection --- it will be provided for a user immediately.
 * * If all connections are busy but its number less than the limit --- a new connection will be created via the #ConnectionSource and provided for a user.
 * * If all connections are busy and there is no room to create a new one --- the request will be placed into the internal queue to wait for the free connection.
 *
 * The request may be limited by time via optional `connection_pool_timeouts` argument of the `connection_pool::operator()`.
 *
 * `connection_pool` models #ConnectionSource concept itself using underlying #ConnectionSource.
 *
 * @tparam Source --- underlying #ConnectionSource which is being used to create connection to a database.
 *
 * ###Example
 *
 * See [examples/connection_pool.cpp](examples/connection_pool.cpp).
 *
 * Creating the connection_pool instance:
@snippet examples/connection_pool.cpp Creating Connection Pool
 *
 * Creating a ConnectionProvider from the connection_pool instance:
